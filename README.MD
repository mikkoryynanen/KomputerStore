## Usage

**Get a Loan** - You may not have two loans at once. The initial loan has to be paid back in full in order to get another loan.

**Work** - Clicking on the work button gives you 100e per click. This money can be sent to your bank by pressing the **"Bank"** button.

**Repay loan** - Repay loan button appears when you have taken up a loan. Loan can be repaid with your *work pay* balance. You have to have the exact amount in your *work pay* balance in order to pay your loan. Any exceeding amount will go to your bank balance.

**Laptops** - Dropdown list of laptops available to you with features listed below. 

**Buy** - With buy button you may purchase a computer of your choosing. Your current bank balance is used for the purchase.
